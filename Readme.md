# Two Arm Collaboration

This is a package for creating and analyzing simulations of tasks performed by two of the Barrett WAM arms.

## About

## Launching a Demo

The `collab_env` package contains demos and the launch files to bring them up.
These include some demos with just markers, and some demos with physical objects the robots can interact with.

For example:
```
roslaunch collab_env test7_pegs.launch
```

### Launch with Spacenav

The launch files in `collab_env` are included in the `collab_spacenav` package.
Use the same names (i.e., `test7_pegs.launch`) in this package to launch with the Space Navigator 3D mouse.

For example:
```
roslaunch collab_spacenav test7_pegs.launch
```
